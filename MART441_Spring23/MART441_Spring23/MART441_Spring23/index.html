    <h2>Me, me, me, more about me</h2>
    <p>I am Christine Martin-Fiore, a junior studying multi-disciplinary studies.  I am a non-traditional student as most of my classmates are younger than my children.
      I completed my AA in August 2021, graduating with honors. It's amazing how much more you appreciate school later in life.  I have 3 adult children, 1 lives in Montana and the other 2 live outside of GA, and 4 grandchildren, who all live GA.  I'm married to
    a wonderful man and we live in Somers, MT. </p>
    <p>Currently I am a partner alliance manager for a SaaS business intelligence company, based out of Orange County, CA.  I attended college out of high school, and played soccer.
    I got hurt playing, decided to take time off school and didn't go back for quite some time.  I started my professional career at Marriott headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland working in the tax department.
    Throughout my career I was responsible for Unclaimed Property reporting, Property Tax compliance, Annual Report Compliance and Sales and Use Tax compliance, research and audit.  I was fortunate enough
    to have had the opportunity to work for a startup SaaS company out of Seattle, Avalara, and privileged to be a part of their IPO.  I have been a speaker at industry events, keynote speaker at corporate
    events and have had my work published.  Two years ago, my boss from Avalara became the US President of a business intelligence software company and asked me to join him.  I manage the relationships
    with our partner, while designing our internal policies and procedures in the hope that I can be a part of another IPO in the next 5 years. </p>
    <p>I am a stage 3 colorectal cancer survivor and have been in remission for 10 years!!! <insert happy dance here>.  I have participated in 10 Susan G Komen 3-Day walks in Atlanta and San Diego. I am also an avid tennis player having won 3 city championships in Atlanta.  Unfortuantely
      while playing in a tournament in St Augustine, FL this past September I tore my achilles tendon, so I've been a bit out of commission. </p>

    <h2>What do things look like to me?</h2>
    <p>I see the world much different today than I did 12 years ago (cancer tends to do that to people).  I spend more time doing fun things and less time buried in my work.  I travel with my girlfriends, hike spectacular places, kayak, golf and enjoy my annual birthday
      beach trip with my best friend of 35 years.  I've come to realize not everyone needs to like me, I'm not everyone's cup of tea.  I don't need to please everyone. I try not to do things that would embarass my children, grandchildren or my husband (although I do dance and sing in the car, which embarasses them).
      I tell my friends and family I love them often, you just never know when you won't be able to again. I thank my doctors who took exceptional care of me, and thank God for giving the ability to continue to make a difference in the world.
