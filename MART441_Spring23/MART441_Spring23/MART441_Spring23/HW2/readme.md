I spent a good part of my time refreshing my memory on what was covered in MART341. <br/>
The Grasshopper site is a great learning tool!  I've used it in the past and find it to be very helpful.  I also downloaded the Codeacademy App on my phone which is has also been a good way to refresh skills.<br/>
I created variables where the list arrays were contained. 
I then combined a heading to the variables.
Lastly, I added commentary on favorite artists.<br/>
I'm still a bit confused as to why something would be written to the Log, but I'm sure this will become more evident as we work through things.<br/>
Including my planning page for Homework 2<br/>
