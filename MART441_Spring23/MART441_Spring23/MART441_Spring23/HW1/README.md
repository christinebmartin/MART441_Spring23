-I spent quite awhile on day 1 relearning how to navigate Github, online and desktop.  Additionally, I was very familiar with Atom, but that is no longer supported so I've been struggling with finding my way around Visual Studio code.
-There was research that needed to be completed on "responsive pages", as that was discussed in a class taken more than 2 years ago.
-[W3Schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/) has been helpful in reaquanting myself to the concepts as well as a previous textbooks.
-Each assignment I use my remarkable tablet to organize notes, and plan assignments. I will share my planning page with each readme
