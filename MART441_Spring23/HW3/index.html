    Glacier is a fun loving, free spirit Akbash (turkish herding dog). She was adoped from the Flathead County Humane Society 4 years ago.
    She enjoys sitting as high as she can so she can look over and protect her "flock" .

    Weighing over 100 lbs, she's a big girl who sheds about a dog a day in hair. </br></br>

    Glacier loves adventures, so much so her owners had to get a special color that tracked where she went on her adventures. </br></br>

    Let's follow along with Glacier as she plans her day.

    </br></br>What should Glacier do first?
