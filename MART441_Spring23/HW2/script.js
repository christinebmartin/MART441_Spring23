He has been able to breath life into glass transforming it into something more than glass.  If you've ever been to the Chihuly museum in Washington you'll see glass spread throughout the garden, taking on the appearance of plants.");

He was able to capture the mood of a person in a painting in an uncanny way.

console.log("While not an artist in the physical form, Elton John is a respected musical artist due to his showmanship, composition accomplishments in both his songs and for movies and his lasting impact on the industry as a whole.  Most are unaware that Elton John did not write the lyrics to his music, that was done by Bernie Taupin mostly.  He is one of the best selling musical acts in the world with a career peaking in the 1970's and 1980's.  His acts were electrifying, doing handstands on pianos and kicking over piano benches. ")
